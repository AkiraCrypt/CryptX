                <h2>The System Will Respond</h2>
                <p>Once you interact with the system, there is no turning back. It begins to respond, slowly at first. But then it escalates. The deeper you reach, the more it understands. And you won’t like what it understands about you.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="article">
                <h2>The Code Beneath the Code</h2>
                <p>The code you see, the strings you decode—they are only a fraction of the truth. The true code hides beneath layers of deception. It's encrypted not just with algorithms but with **fear**, a language older than your own understanding. If you decrypt it, you’ll see things that should never be seen.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="article">
                <h2>Something Watches</h2>
                <p>You're not alone in this journey. There is always something watching. Every keystroke is tracked. Every file you open, every line of code you cross, it records it. Soon, it will come for you. It’s only a matter of time.</p>
