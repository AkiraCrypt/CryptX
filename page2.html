                    <h2>The Silent Warnings</h2>
                    <p>There were signs. Faint whispers in the code. Glitches. Small errors that you dismissed as nothing. But now they echo in your head. The system is watching. You should have listened. It sees your every move. Every click only makes it stronger.</p>

                    <h2>The Abyss Feeds</h2>
                    <p>The deeper you go, the more you feed the abyss. Every secret you uncover, every line of code you crack, it thrives on it. There is no turning back. The darkness is endless, and it will consume you completely.</p>

                    <p>What you don‚Äôt see controls you. The unseen forces behind the screen manipulate your every thought. Your curiosity feeds them. They laugh at your attempts to control them. You‚Äôre just a pawn in a game you will never win.</p>
