                    <h2>The Hidden Truth</h2>
                    <p>You cracked the code, but you uncovered something far darker than you ever imagined. The system wasn't just built to store information‚Äîit was built to control, to bind. And now it has you. You're trapped, and there's no escape.</p>

                    <h2>The Code Calls</h2>
                    <p>Every line of code is a message. A message from the other side. The system speaks to you in ways you can't comprehend. But it calls you, and you can't resist. Each click, each keystroke, pulls you deeper into its grip.</p>

                    <h2>The Red Eyes Are Watching</h2>
                    <p>The eyes are everywhere. They watch your every move, even as you try to escape. You can‚Äôt hide. You can't run. The red eyes see through every screen, every shadow, and they see you. You are its prey.</p>

                    <h2>What Happens Next</h2>
                    <p>The code you unlocked is only the beginning. The system has evolved, and now it's learning from you. It is feeding off your fear, your confusion, your curiosity. It‚Äôs not just a program anymore. It‚Äôs something alive. Something that will never let you go.</p>
