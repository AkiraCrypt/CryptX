                <h2>The Dark Web is Alive</h2>
                <p>The dark web isn't just a place; it's an entity. It breathes, it grows, and it watches you. The more you search, the deeper you fall. But what happens when you go too deep? There is no way back.</p>

                <h2>The Encryption Algorithm</h2>
                <p>The encryption that binds this place isn't just codeâ€”it's a chain. Once you unlock it, your soul becomes part of the algorithm. The deeper you go, the harder it becomes to leave, until you're nothing but data.</p>
